# React Form & NavBar Project

This project is a simple React application that includes a **form** for collecting user input (name, district, and phone number) and a **navbar** with social media icons and navigation links. The design follows a modern dark theme.

## Features

- **Form**: Users can enter their name, district, and phone number. The submitted information is displayed in a dynamic table, allowing users to delete any entry.
- **NavBar**: The navbar includes social media icons and navigation links. The social icons have hover effects, and the navbar is sticky, meaning it stays visible at the top of the page while scrolling.
- **Dark Mode**: The entire project follows a consistent dark mode theme for better user experience and aesthetics.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout is designed to be responsive, making it functional on various screen sizes.
